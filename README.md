Road Accident Analysis using Machine Learning
In recent years, traffic accident analysis drew considerable attention to the researchers 
to determine the factors that significantly affect traffic accidents. But unfortunately, 
maximum research methods are based on statistical records or by doing some simple 
surveys based on interviews or questionnaires. But, it is not possible to get a better and 
unerring solution 6 by using these types of primitive approaches. The main puzzle is 
that behavioral features in traffic accidents are quite difficult to study by these kinds of 
traditional research methods because accidents are relatively unpredictable and 
extemporaneous, so direct observation is quite difficult

The traffic has been transformed into a difficult structure in terms of designing and 
managing by the increasing number of vehicles. In recent years, road accidents have 
become a global problem and marked as the ninth prominent cause of death in the 
world. The dramatic increase in road traffic accidents in the world is causing serious 
problems in every aspect of human lives. Due to the enormous number of road accidents 
every year, it has become a major problem in the world. The following project is done 
in order to know the severity of the road accidents and the reasons behind these road 
accidents. There might be numerous reasons or you can say numerous factors for a 
road accident. So the purpose is to determine the reasons or factors for the road 
accident. For this purpose we are using ML or Machine Learning. Machine Learning 
takes insights from the past and depicts the future based on the past events. Different 
Machine Learning Algorithms are used in this project.
